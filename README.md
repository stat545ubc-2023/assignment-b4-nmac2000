## Strings and functional programming

This Assignment contained two parts: 

Part 1: I made a graph of the 10 words used the most in <ins> Pride and Prejudice </ins> by Jane Austen.

Part 2: I created a new pig latin language. The rules are as follows:

1) Arrangement: If a word starts with a vowel, the first letter is removed and will be added after the arrangement component.
    If the word starts with a consonant, all letters leading to the first vowel are removed and will be added after the arrangement component
 2) Addition: If a word starts with a vowel, "ta" is added to the beginning of the word, and "ta" + letter removed from arrangement component are added to the end of the word.
   If a word starts with a consonant, "at" is added to the beginning of the word, and "ta" + letter(s) removed from arrangement component are added to the end of the word
